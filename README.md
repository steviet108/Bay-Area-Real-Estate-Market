This is an Analysis of the San Francisco Real Estate Market to decide if investing into that market is a good idea. I have used Jupyter Lab to create several dataframes that presents the original data different ways in the hopes of observing relationships, trends and insight into what is going on with the San Francisco real estate market. 


## Technologies

This analysis uses Python 3.7 with the following packages:

``` pandas ```

``` pathlib ```

``` hvplot ```

``` geoviews ```

## Installation Guide

This analysis was done with Jupyter Lab. To interact with the functions, first install the following:

``` python 3.7 ```

It is a good idea to install hvplot and geoviews into a virtual environment. To do this first make sure you are not already in a virtual environment with 

``` conda deactivate ```  then  ``` conda update conda ``` then  ``` conda update anaconda ``` then you will want to create a new virtual environment by 
``` conda create -n dev python=3.7 anaconda ``` then  ``` conda activate dev ``` after you have created a new virtual environment, go ahead and install hvplot and geoviews with a ``` conda install -c pyviz hvplot geoviews ```

## Usage
